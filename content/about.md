I enjoy machine learning and algorithms. My facination towards of programming began in my freshman year when I learnt C. The year later I started learning C++, which later paved my path to pursue competitive programming. I even like to solve problems around me by codifying them. Once small problem which I solved duing my undergrad is by making a mess menu bot on discord which is being used by 1500+ people.  I dream on working as a research scientist in AI.

# Current day

I'm currently working towards improving on competitive programming at [Codeforces](https://www.codeforces.com) and working as a research assistant at my university while studying 7<sup>th</sup> semester in Computer Science at Mahindra University, Hyderabad. 


# Research

The following are my research papers which I have contributed to as a research assistant and co-authored:

> Sai Siddhartha Vivek Dhir Rangoju, Om Prakash Patel and Neha Bharill, “Advanced Quantum Inspired Evolutionary Optimization Algorithm”, International Conference on Emerging Techniques in Computational Intelligence (ICETCI), IEEE, pp.57-64, August 25, 2022.
