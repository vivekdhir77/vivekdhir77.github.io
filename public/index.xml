      <description>I enjoy machine learning and algorithms. My facination towards of programming began in my freshman year when I learnt C. The year later I started learning C++, which later paved my path to pursue competitive programming. I even like to solve problems around me by codifying them. Once small problem which I solved duing my undergrad is by making a mess menu bot on discord which is being used by 1500+ people.</description>
